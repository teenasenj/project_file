        <h4>Vendor facilities</h4>
        <p>The fabric scraps are repurposed to make hair bands and potli bags rather than simply being discarded.

        <p>And the prints! Our prints are created just for you.

          With every garment, we give you a seed ball. 
          water it, give it some sunshine. Watch in wonder and grow your own garden.</p>
