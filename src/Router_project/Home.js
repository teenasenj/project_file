        <h4>Vendor facilities</h4>
        <p>The fabric scraps are repurposed to make hair bands and potli bags rather than simply being discarded.

        <h4> Prints</h4>
        <p>And the prints! Our prints are created just for you. 
          They are beautiful, of course, but they are also designed to spark ideas and tell new stories.
          With every garment, we give you a seed ball. 
          water it, give it some sunshine. Watch in wonder and grow your own garden.</p>
